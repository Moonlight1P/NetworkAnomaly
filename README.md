# NetworkAnomaly
A Network anomaly detection system to identify suspicious traffic patterns and potential security threats.
Generated and analyzed simulated network traffic data with a higher proportion of normal activity to reflect real-world scenarios.
Applied the Isolation Forest algorithm for unsupervised anomaly detection with an optimized contamination rate to reduce false positives.
Applied the Isolation Forest model trained on routine network traffic, with key network parameters like IP, TCP Flags, TTL.
Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
